## 📖 About Me

My interest in technology and computer science began early, leading me to complete my initial training as a **State-Certified Technical Assistant for Computer Science**.

My academic path began with a degree program in **Computer Science**. Seeking a deeper connection to practical applications, I later transitioned my studies to **Electrical Engineering and Information Technology**. This shift was a deliberate move to get closer to real-world technical challenges. Ultimately, this experience reaffirmed my core ambition: to build high-quality software as a professional developer.

Today, after several years in demanding development roles, I have significantly expanded and sharpened my technical competencies. I remain dedicated to my goal of applying my knowledge efficiently to create impactful solutions. I pride myself on a **diligent work ethic**, a **quick grasp of new concepts**, and a **collaborative team spirit** when solving practical challenges.
